## Summary

The paper argues that the Second Law of Thermodynamics **cannot** be a **universal** fundamental law in the form “entropy does not decrease” (strict trajectory-wise or as a universal statistical principle) when microscopic dynamics are time-reversal invariant. The core is a **mirror-state construction**: for any microstate \(A\), its time-reversed partner \(B\) (momenta inverted) leads to a contradiction if universal monotonicity is applied to both, forcing entropy to be constant on every trajectory and removing any entropic arrow of time. The consistent replacement is that **entropy has no direction**; it is described by a **probability distribution** \(P(S)\), whose shape depends on **constraints and boundary conditions** \(\lambda\). The paper proves from first principles that constraints reshape the long-time entropy distribution \(P_{\infty}(S;\lambda)\) by altering the invariant measure (Hamiltonian and/or accessible phase space), with a **sharp criterion** in the microcanonical case: the distribution changes only by translation when all accessible macrostate volumes are scaled by a common factor; otherwise it changes structurally. **Experimental validation** (Qiao–Wang: charged nanopores, out-of-equilibrium ion distribution, work from a single thermal reservoir) is discussed as supporting the constraint-reshaped entropy framework and the feasibility of devices based on it.

## Paper structure (entropy.tex)

1. **Introduction** — Two forms of the Second Law (strict vs statistical); scope: universal claims under time-reversal invariant dynamics.
2. **Preliminaries and assumptions**
   - Microscopic dynamics and time reversal (\(\mathcal{T}\), mirror states).
   - Entropy as coarse-grained state function (Boltzmann, energy-shell).
   - Continuity / minimal regularity.
   - Meaning of \(P_{\infty}(S;\lambda)\) (long-time distribution from invariant measure).
3. **The mirror-state paradox**
   - Strict trajectory-wise monotonicity is impossible as a universal law (proof).
   - Extension: the statistical Second Law cannot be universal.
4. **Corrected view** — Entropy as a random variable with constraint-dependent PDF.
5. **First-principles derivation: \(\lambda \to P_{\infty}(S;\lambda)\)**
   - Constraints as Hamiltonian / accessible-set modifications.
   - Long-time invariant measures (microcanonical and canonical).
   - Boltzmann entropy on the energy shell.
   - Closed-form \(P_{\infty}(S;\lambda)\) and sharp criterion (translation-only vs structural change).
   - Qualifier: changing rates vs changing invariant measure.
6. **Experimental validation** — Qiao–Wang experiment; interpretation via constraint-reshaped \(P_{\infty}(S;\lambda)\); spontaneous low-entropy transitions without compensating entropy increase.
7. **Conclusion** — Summary, perpetual motion of the second kind, heat death, outlook.

The manuscript includes an inline bibliography (thebibliography) with references to Goldstein et al., Callen, Pathria & Beale, Kubo et al., Lebowitz, Qiao–Wang, and the author’s earlier work (Peng, geometry/entropy/rectification).

## FAQ (faq.tex / faq.pdf)

The FAQ is a short, standalone Q&A document that accompanies the paper. It is prepared by Ting Peng (t.peng@ieee.org) and cites the arXiv version above. It covers:

1. What is the mirror-state paradox?
2. Does this disprove the Second Law of Thermodynamics?
3. What replaces “entropy has a direction”?
4. What is \(P_{\infty}(S;\lambda)\)?
5. How do constraints reshape the entropy distribution?
6. When does \(P_{\infty}^{(E)}(S;\lambda)\) stay the same (up to translation)?
7. What does the Qiao–Wang experiment show?
8. Does this mean a perpetual motion machine of the second kind is possible?
9. What about heat death?
10. Which definition of entropy is used?

Build the FAQ with `make faq`; output is `faq.pdf`.
